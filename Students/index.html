<h2> BitPro – How We Utilize GitHub in the Work Place </h2>

<p>In bitpro, we use the open source software known as Github to communicate and collaborate on various different projects. It allows us to store vast numbers of documents that each team member would need to work on, which can be done via uploading into a team repository of which all members have access to. A repository in Github is basically like a file branch system, allowing you to categorize as well as organise all your work. It is also a great way to manage version control, as we do come across the issue of managing multiple versions of the same document. Furthermore, if you wish to upload individual work that you have done in some free time, then using a private repository would be beneficial as only you and the team manager can view the work that repository contains. </p> 

<p> Another key feature we use on Github is the issue track, which is our primary way of communicating our views on each documentation or project. The issue tracker is an excellent way to inform co-workers of any changes that could be made to a document or if the document is up to standard. This way we are ensuring that each piece of work, whether project related or not, gets feedback from our team members to ensure that we produce the highest quality work possible. </p>

<h2>Avaliable Occupations</h2>
<p>BitPro offers a small variety of jobs that are based around certain skill levels, which al include a certain level of self-guided learning.</p>

<h3>Communications Consultant:</h3>
<p>The Communications Consultant position requires a certain level of creativity, including a general understanding of technical and communication conventions. The job itself will require you to carry out certain tasks set by your team leader, which can range from editing and proof reading a professional documentation, or gathering information from specified sources (i.e. interviews, internet searching, etc.) Furthermore, it will require a great deal of active listening and critical thinking. This will allow you to apply new forms of communication that you have learned and implement them when necessary. </p>

<h3>Technical Consultant:</h3>
<p>The Technical Consultant is much like that of the communications consultant, however, this revolves more around presenting documentation rather than gathering information for it. This includes such tasks as web design, implementing programming skills into documents, and understanding information technology hardware. In this position, you are highly expected to use initiative and pursue work if you are left without a task; in other words you must keep yourself busy at all times to benefit the team. </p>

<h3>Team Leader:</h3>
<p>This critical role requires you to motivate and manage a small team of co-workers, each of which will have their own role. This will require you to be flexible, self-motivated, and fair towards your co-workers. Your main objective is to ensure that each team member is carrying out their set task by you and producing high quality work. You are also required to report directly to the managing director on such matters as team meetings, agendas, progress of work, and relaying a carefully constructed summary of what your team has accomplished during each set task. </p>
