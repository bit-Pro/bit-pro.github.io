BitPro Projects

BitPro has completed projects for internal clients and are branching out to external clients.

Internally at Otago Polytechnic, we were tasked to provide a professional flyer which adhered to the Otago Polytechnic branding guide which would be used by the leader of the College of Enterprise and Development.
Each team created a single flyer which we presented to our client and recieved feedback on.

We also created this website as a way to spread BitPro towards a wider audience and to spread interest with each team at BitPro creating
a page for a specific purpose. This is our ongoing project throughout the semester.

Externally, we are currently writing a proposal to the Dunedin Refugee Steering Group for a technological solution to communicating and providing
information about the newcomers to the city. This will include spreading information to groups and organisations and informing individuals visiting 
Dunedin for the first time.
