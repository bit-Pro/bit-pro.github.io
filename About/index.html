			<h2>About BitPro</h2>
			
			<p>BitPro is a professional class made up of people throughout the B.I.T 3-year course that enables students who are split into teams to take on I.T. related projects.</p>

			<h3>What do we do?</h3>
			<p>Throughout the course, we learn how to adapt and created professional Cover Letters and CVs without clutter than are easy to read and customized to specific jobs. Skills and techniques are studied, learnt and tried out on each other regarding job interview situations. Much of the class is self-directed, with a trial and error approach.</p>


			<h3>Workshops</h3>

			<p>We have regular workshops where we learn and discuss different topics relating to the workforce and work environment. This can be as simple as how we present ourselves to how we build a rapport with fellow workmates.</p>

			<h3>Outcomes</h3>

			<p>Our goals at the end of this class is to be able to successfully demonstrate effective job application skills, apply a group/tem methodology in a workplace-like context. We should be able to demonstrate appropriate I.T. industry communication skills and apply these in the real world. Produce quality I.T. related writing which contributes to group goals, apply the fundamentals of project management to team-based projects, and can analyse our personal performance and take actions to improve it.</p>
